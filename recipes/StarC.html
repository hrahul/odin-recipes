    <h2>Description</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <p>
            Place 1 cup of water, eggs, salt, sugar, bread flour, 
            and yeast into the pan of a bread machine in the order
            recommended by the manufacturer.
            Select the Dough setting, and start the machine.
        </p>
        <li>Step 2</li>
        <p>
            When cycle is completed, remove dough from the machine, 
            and set onto a floured work surface for 15 minutes to rest. 
            Cover dough with a towel or large bowl to prevent drying out.
        </p>
        <li>Step 3</li>
        <p>
            Knead the dough several times, and cut into 6 equal pieces.
            Roll each piece out into a rope about 10 inches long and 1 inch in diameter.
        </p>
        <li>Step 4</li>
        <p>
            Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 
            Lay 3 ropes of bread onto the prepared baking sheet,
            and pinch ropes together firmly at the ends to form a pointed triangle. 
            Weave 3 more ropes over and underneath each point of the first triangle to make a second,
            interwoven triangle. Pinch it closed tightly at the edges to make a 6-pointed star. 
            Set the baking sheet in a warm place, and allow to rise until doubled, 30 to 45 minutes.
        </p>
        <li>Step 5</li>
        <p>
            Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees 
            Whisk egg yolk with 1 tablespoon of water, and brush 
            the mixture over the loaf; sprinkle with sesame seeds.
        </p>
        <li>Step 6</li>
        <p>
            Bake in the preheated oven until the challah is shiny, 
            golden brown, and sounds hollow when tapped, about 35 minutes.
        </p>
